    <h1>Math</h1>
    <h3>Multi-Digit Multiplication</h3>
    <p>Now that you understand place value, you can multiply bigger numbers. For example, to calculate 23 √ó 15, you can do 23√ó10 + 23√ó5 = 345. Understanding place value helps with multiplying, dividing, and solving real-world problems.</p>

    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <h3>Summarizing and Inference</h3>
    <p>In reading, we practice summarizing paragraphs and making inferences. For example: 
    "Penguins are birds that cannot fly but swim very well. They live in large groups and slide on ice to move quickly. Penguins eat fish and work together to find food." 
    Main idea: Penguins are strong swimmers that live and hunt together. We can infer that penguins are social animals that rely on teamwork.</p>

    <h1>Science</h1>
    <h3>Tides and Eclipses</h3>
    <p>The Moon‚Äôs gravity affects Earth‚Äôs oceans and causes tides. Spring tides happen when the Sun and Moon align. Solar and lunar eclipses happen when the Sun, Earth, and Moon line up. Understanding tides and eclipses helps us predict patterns in nature and space.</p>
