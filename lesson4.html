    <h1>Math</h1>
    <h3>Prime Numbers and Patterns</h3>
    <p>Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Recognizing prime numbers and patterns helps solve problems faster and understand the structure of numbers. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are prime numbers.</p>

    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <h3>Cause and Effect in Texts</h3>
    <p>In reading, we focus on cause and effect. For example: "It rained all night, so the streets were flooded." The cause is rain, and the effect is flooding. Understanding cause and effect helps us better predict what might happen in a story or in real life.</p>

    <h1>Science</h1>
    <h3>Solar System and Planet Motion</h3>
    <p>The planets orbit the Sun in predictable paths because of gravity. Each planet moves at a different speed and distance from the Sun. Understanding planetary motion helps us know seasons, years, eclipses, and why planets stay in orbit.</p>
