    <h1>Math</h1>
    <h3>Review of Key Concepts</h3>
    <p>In math, we learned place value, which helps us understand the value of each digit in a number. We practiced multi-digit multiplication, factors and multiples, and identified prime numbers. Understanding these concepts helps us solve problems, do calculations faster, and recognize patterns in numbers.</p>

    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <h3>Review of Reading Skills</h3>
    <p>In reading, we practiced summarizing paragraphs, making inferences, comparing ideas across paragraphs, and understanding cause and effect. These skills help us understand stories, paragraphs, and real-world information more clearly and accurately.</p>

    <h1>Science</h1>
    <h3>Review of Science Topics</h3>
    <p>In science, we learned about the Moon’s phases and how they affect tides. We explored eclipses, gravity, and how it keeps the Moon orbiting Earth and planets orbiting the Sun. We also studied planetary motion and how the solar system works. These concepts help us understand patterns in space and nature.</p>
