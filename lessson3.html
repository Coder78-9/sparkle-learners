    <h1>Math</h1>
    <h3>Factors and Multiples</h3>
    <p>Now we learn about factors and multiples. Factors are numbers that divide evenly into another number. Multiples are numbers you get when you multiply a number by whole numbers. Understanding factors and multiples helps with division, multiplication, and problem-solving in real life.</p>

    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <h3>Comparing Ideas Across Paragraphs</h3>
    <p>In reading, we practice comparing ideas across paragraphs. For example: 
    "Paragraph 1: Lions live in groups called prides. They hunt together and share food." 
    "Paragraph 2: Tigers are solitary hunters and live alone." 
    Comparing shows how lions and tigers behave differently. This helps us understand patterns and make inferences.</p>

    <h1>Science</h1>
    <h3>Orbits and Gravity</h3>
    <p>Planets orbit the Sun because of gravity. The Moon orbits Earth for the same reason. Gravity keeps everything moving in space predictably. Understanding orbits helps explain seasons, tides, and eclipses in a deeper way.</p>
